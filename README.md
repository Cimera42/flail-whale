# Flail Whale

## About

A game made for [GMTK Game Jam 2021](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021). The theme was "Joined".

The rather grim gameplay I ended up on was harpooning a whale, which then pulls your boat around as you dodge islands.

## Running and building

To run the game in live-reload mode, use `yarn start`.

To build a deployable bundle, use `yarn build`. The bundle will be placed in the `build` folder.

## Controls

-   A/D to turn, W/S for forward and reverse
-   Left click to shoot harpoon
-   Right click to release the harpoon (do this if you're gonna die!!)
-   M to mute audio
-   R to restart level (when dead)
-   N to go to new level (after winning once)
